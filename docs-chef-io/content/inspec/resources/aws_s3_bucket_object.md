Use the `aws_s3_bucket_object` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS bucket object.

Each S3 Object has a 'key' which can be thought of as the name of the S3 Object which uniquely identifies it.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on S3 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html).

## Installation

{{% inspec_aws_install %}}

## Syntax

An `aws_s3_bucket_object` resource block declares a bucket and an object key by name, and then lists tests to be performed.

```ruby
describe aws_s3_bucket_object(bucket_name: 'test_bucket', key: 'test_object_key') do
  it { should exist }
  it { should_not be_public }
end
```

## Parameters

`bucket_name` _(required)_

: The S3 Bucket Name which uniquely identifies the bucket. 
  This must be passed as a `bucket_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

`key` _(required)_

: The S3 Bucket Key which uniquely identifies the bucket object. 
  This must be passed as a `key: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

## Properties

`bucket_name`
: The name of the bucket.

`key`
: The key within the bucket.

`content_length`
: Size of the body in bytes.

`content_type`
: A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

`object_acl`
: An array of AWS Grants detailing permission grants on the bucket object.

There are also additional properties available. For a comprehensive list, see [the API reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html).

## Examples

**Test an object's object-level ACL.**

```ruby
describe aws_s3_bucket_object(bucket_name: 'test_bucket', key: 'test_key') do
  its('object_acl.count') { should eq 1 }
end
```

**Test an object's size in bytes is less than `100000`.**

```ruby
describe aws_s3_bucket_object(bucket_name: 'test_bucket', key: 'test_key') do
  its('content_length') { should be < 1_000_000 }
end
```

**Test an object's type is "image/jpeg".**

```ruby
describe aws_s3_bucket_object(bucket_name: 'test_bucket', key: 'test_key') do
  its('content_type') { should eq "image/jpeg" }
end
```

**Check to see if a object appears to be exposed to the public.**

```ruby
describe aws_s3_bucket_object(bucket_name: 'test_bucket', key: 'test_key') do
  it { should_not be_public }
end
```


## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers (such as `exist`) please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### be_public

The `be_public` matcher tests if the object has potentially insecure access controls. This high-level matcher detects several insecure conditions, which may be enhanced in the future. Currently, the matcher reports an insecure object if any of the following conditions are met:

  1. A object ACL grant exists for the 'AllUsers' group
  2. A object ACL grant exists for the 'AuthenticatedUsers' group

Note: This resource does not detect insecure bucket ACLs.

```ruby
it { should_not be_public }
```

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `S3:Client:GetObjectOutput`, and `S3:Client:GetObjectAclOutput` actions set to allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html).
